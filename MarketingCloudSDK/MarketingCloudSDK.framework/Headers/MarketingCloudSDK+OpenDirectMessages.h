/**
 Supporting protocol for OpenDirect with Alert, part of the Salesforce 2016-04 release.
 
 Implementation of this delegate is not required for OpenDirect with Alert to function, but it is provided as a convenience to developers who do not wish to parse the push payload on their own.
 
 All OpenDirect data is passed down as a JSON String, the MarketingCloud SDK will parse and return as a NSDictionary. Please remember to parse it appropriately from there. Also, please remember to fail gracefully if you can't take action on the message.
 
 Also, please note that setting a OpenDirect with Alert Delegate will negate the automatic webpage load feature in the MarketingCloud SDK.
