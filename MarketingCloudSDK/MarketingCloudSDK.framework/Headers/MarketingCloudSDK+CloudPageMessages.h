/**
 Supporting protocol for Alert with CloudPage, part of the Salesforce 213 release.
 
 Implementation of this delegate is not required for Alert with CloudPage to function, but it is provided as a convenience to developers who do not wish to parse the push payload on their own.
 
 All CloudPage data is passed down as a JSON String, the MarketingCloud SDK will parse and return as a NSDictionary. Please remember to parse it appropriately from there. Also, please remember to fail gracefully if you can't take action on the message.
 
 Also, please note that setting a Alert with CloudPage Delegate will negate the automatic webpage load feature in the MarketingCloud SDK.
